## About

The API SDK Creator project is trying to take a new approach to helping developers quickly, and 
easily build API client SDKs for any API. However, it's still in a fledging state as it tries 
to find it's feet.

Contributions are probably going to be for bug fixes as us here at RedCrew try this project out 
and see what works and what doesn't.

If you have found a defect please raise an issue and we'll fix it.
