# Development

The repository is managed by [Rush](https://rushjs.io). As such, the Rush [Command Set](https://rushjs.io/pages/commands/rush_add/) needs to be used to add/remove/update packages and to build/publish the modules/libraries that make up the `@sdk-creator` set.

Note: Using `rushx` is the equivalent to using `npm run`

## Building

```shell script
$ rush install
$ rush build
```

## Testing

```shell script
$ rushx test
```
